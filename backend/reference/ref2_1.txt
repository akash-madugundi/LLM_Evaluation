Supervised Learning
Learns from labeled data to predict outcomes for new data.
Example Algorithms: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Unsupervised Learning
Finds hidden patterns or structures in unlabeled data.
Example Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), DBSCAN
