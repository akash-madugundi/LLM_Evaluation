Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Machine learning can be broadly categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning, each serving different purposes and using different types of data.

1. Supervised Learning
   - Definition: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each training example is paired with an output label.
   - Goal: The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, so the model can predict the label for new, unseen data.
   - Examples: Classification tasks (e.g., spam detection, image recognition), regression tasks (e.g., predicting house prices).
   - Algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, neural networks.
   - Key Point: Requires labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Definition: Unsupervised learning involves training models on data without labeled responses. The model tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
   - Goal: To discover meaningful information, such as grouping or reducing dimensionality, without predefined labels.
   - Examples: Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), anomaly detection.
   - Algorithms: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders.
   - Key Point: Does not require labeled data, making it useful when labeling is not feasible.

Summary:
- Supervised learning requires labeled input-output pairs and focuses on prediction.
- Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and focuses on discovering structure.

Both approaches are fundamental to machine learning and have diverse applications across industries.
