Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets, where each input is paired with a corresponding output label. Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. In contrast, unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled data to discover inherent patterns or groupings. Popular algorithms include K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Hierarchical Clustering.
